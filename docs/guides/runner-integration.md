# Integrate a controlling runner

ZEO Creator is deliberately runner-neutral. Sovereign Agent and a managed ZEO
runtime use the same capability registry, request models, and results.

## Discover capabilities

```python
from zeo_creator.registry import capability_registry

registry = capability_registry()
capability = registry.get("creator.research_synthesis@1.0.0")
```

For LLM tool surfaces:

```python
from zeo_creator.registry import openai_tool_projections

tools = openai_tool_projections()
```

Projection does not grant authority. It only translates the manifest into a
runner-compatible function description.

## Construct context

Production runners should construct `ToolContext` themselves. The convenience
`make_context` helper exists for examples and bounded local workflows.

Read capabilities require named services:

| Capability | Required service |
|---|---|
| Research synthesis | `creator.evidence_source` |
| Performance assessment | `creator.metrics_source` |

Pure transformations require neither service nor network access.

## Keep runtime state outside artifacts

Persist capability results as revisioned artifacts, but keep these in the
runtime:

- commitments and schedules;
- retry and resumption state;
- approval state and approving principals;
- effect-authority grants;
- connector credentials;
- execution receipts and reconciliation workflow; and
- organizational policy decisions.

## Govern writes

`creator.prepare_distribution` returns a proposal whose `required_effects` are
`write` and `external_communication`. This describes what a later execution
would require. The capability itself declares no provider write and executes
nothing.

The runtime must authorize the exact operation fields covered by the approval
digest. A broad permission such as “may post to LinkedIn” is not equivalent to
approval of one artifact, payload, destination, and schedule.

## Failure behavior

- Missing required services produce Zeocore's unavailable result before domain
  logic runs.
- Domain policy failures return enumerated `ZEO_CREATOR_*` error codes.
- Invalid requests fail Pydantic validation before invocation.
- Provider and connection failures belong to the injected adapter/runtime layer.

Use these distinctions to decide whether to correct input, request approval,
retry an observation, or escalate operationally.
