# Capability catalog

The twenty original capabilities retain `1.0.0`; the nine email capabilities use
`4.0.0`. Each manifest includes JSON request
and response schemas, effects, requirements, examples, projections, and typed
error codes.

Use `zeo-creator capabilities --json` for canonical manifests or
`zeo-creator capabilities --projection openai` for function-tool projections.

Zeocore 0.9 requires every manifest to carry at least one effect kind. Pure
transformations therefore conservatively declare `read`; the email family also
carries the `pure` tag and has no required acquisition services or network access. This
compatibility boundary can be removed if Zeocore gains an explicit pure effect.

Workflow composition, scheduling, retries, approval waits, and effect authorization are
runtime concerns; the package deliberately exposes no monolithic workflow.

The query-based research and performance v1 capabilities are retained for legacy
compatibility. Canonical email assessment uses already-collected observations in
`assess_email_program`; never inject a live connector into that capability.
